## 🔬 Technical Details

### Methodology:

1. **Data Collection:** USGS Earthquake API (2010-2019, M≥4.0)
2. **Feature Engineering:**

   - Inter-event time & distance (Haversine formula)
   - Seismic energy (log₁₀ Joules)
   - Local b-value (Gutenberg-Richter law)
   - Temporal features (hour, day, month)
   - Multi-dimensional states (magnitude × depth × region)

3. **Model Architecture:**

   - 2nd-order Markov Chain (considers 2 previous earthquakes)
   - 135 combined states
   - Transition matrix: 18,225 × 135
   - 99.27% sparsity

4. **Validation:**
   - 80/20 train/test split
   - Baseline: Stationary Poisson process
   - Metrics: Probability forecasts for 1/5/10 days

### Algorithm Pseudocode:

```python
# 1. Load historical earthquakes
earthquakes = download_usgs_data(region="Indonesia", min_mag=4.0)

# 2. Engineer features
features = engineer_features(earthquakes)
# -> inter_event_time, inter_event_distance, seismic_energy, b_value
# -> magnitude_bin, depth_bin, region_bin -> combined_state

# 3. Build 2nd-order transition matrix
P[i,j,k] = Probability(State_k | State_i, State_j)
# -> Matrix size: (n_states * n_states) × n_states

# 4. Forecast next earthquake
last_two_states = [state_t-1, state_t]
next_state_probs = transition_matrix[last_two_states]

# 5. Decode predicted states
predicted_regions = decode_states(top_k_states)
# -> Region, Magnitude, Depth, Probability
```

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

🔔 **This is probabilistic forecasting, NOT deterministic prediction**

- Cannot predict exact time, location, and magnitude
- Provides probability estimates based on historical patterns
- Use for **preparedness**, not for panic

🔔 **Academic & Research Purpose**

- System designed for educational and research purposes
- Not a replacement for official earthquake monitoring agencies
- Always follow official information from **BMKG Indonesia**

🔔 **Model Limitations**

- Trained on historical data (2010-2019)
- Assumes stationary earthquake patterns
- Does not account for: tectonic stress buildup, foreshocks, geological changes
- Best for medium-term forecasting (1-10 days)

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: Can this predict the exact time and location of an earthquake?
**A:** No. This system provides **probabilistic forecasting**, not deterministic prediction. It estimates the likelihood of earthquakes in different regions based on historical patterns.

### Q2: How accurate is the prediction?
**A:** The model achieves:
- 23.5% accuracy for 1-day window
- 100% accuracy for 5-10 day window (earthquake will occur somewhere in Indonesia)

### Q3: Can I use this for real-world disaster preparedness?
**A:** This is an **academic research project**. Always rely on official sources like **BMKG Indonesia** for earthquake warnings. Use this system for research and educational purposes only.

### Q4: Why 2nd-order Markov Chain?
**A:** 2nd-order considers the last 2 earthquakes, capturing more complex patterns than 1st-order (which only looks at current state). It balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

### Q5: Can I modify the code for other countries?
**A:** Yes! Simply change the region parameter in the USGS API call. The code is modular and can be adapted for any seismically active region.

### Q6: How long does it take to run?
**A:** Complete execution takes **2-3 minutes** on a standard laptop (Intel i5, 8GB RAM).
